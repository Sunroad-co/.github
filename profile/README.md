Connecting local artists with their communities.
Sunroad is building a platform for artists to showcase their work, reach new audiences, and grow together.

## 🌞  What is Sunroad?
Sunroad is a community-driven marketplace and discovery platform where artists can:
- 🎨 Create public profiles to share their story, artworks, and events  
- 🖼️ Showcase galleries with images, video, and stories  
- 📍 Connect with local communities and opportunities  
- 🌐 Reach wider audiences through modern, scalable web tech  

We’re re-imagining the artist directory as a **living, breathing platform** that celebrates creativity and community.

Sunroad is a community project in progress. Follow our journey as we bring local art closer to the world.
